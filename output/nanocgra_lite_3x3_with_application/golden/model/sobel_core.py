"""sobel_core — Sobel Gx/Gy shift-add compute + magnitude saturate.

Hardware: rtl/sobel_core.v
Ports (name, dir, width):
  win         input  72   (9 x 8-bit window, row-major 0=TL..8=BR)
  sobel_out   output 8    (|Gx|+|Gy| saturated to 0..255)

This is the pure combinational Sobel datapath.  It computes:

  Gx = -w0 + w2 - 2*w3 + 2*w5 - w6 + w8
  Gy = -w0 - 2*w1 - w2 + w6 + 2*w7 + w8
  out = min(|Gx| + |Gy|, 255)

All weights are 0, +/-1, +/-2 so the computation is shifts and adds.
The intermediate Gx, Gy are signed 9-bit (-510..+510); the magnitude
|Gx|+|Gy| is 0..1020 and is saturated to unsigned 8-bit.
